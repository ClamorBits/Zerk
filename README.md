# Zerk
Zerk is your virtual assistant.
## Quick summary
I've been learning Python, and would think to have some small project. Decided to create this. Planned going to be a clippy-like thing, but it's a progressive progress
### Releases
Check releases [here](https://github.com/ClamorBits/Zerk/releases/)
### Contributors, issues,  and pull requests
I am not an advanced programmer, so I feel like I wouldn't work more than other contributors. But if you do want to be a contributor, contact @ClamorBits on Telegram. Feel free to post any questions, suggestions, or bugfixes on the issues section. Feel free to open a pull request if you want to.
##### About Source Code
The source code is the censored-Zerk ID version of it, but the release have the Zerk ID working so if you do have a Zerk ID feel free to enter it.
#### Obtaining a Zerk ID
If you want to have a Zerk ID, contact @ClamorBits on Telegram. Your Zerk ID will be added on the next Zerk update since I currently don't use any remote connection data system such as SQL.
